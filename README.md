# The 4th Wave of Social-Media: The Rise of Decentralized Networks

**Social-Media is evolving — again.**
From MySpace to Facebook, from Twitter to TikTok, each iteration has reshaped how we connect.
Now, a new revolution is here: **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**).
But what exactly is it, and how does it differ from what came before?
Let’s dive into the **4th wave of social-networking**.

## 3rd Wave

The **4th wave** of social-media marks a **new wave** — and includes **Bluesky**, **Farcaster**, the **Fediverse**, **Mastodon**, **Nostr**, and **Pixelfed**, among others.

But knowing the _previous_ **3rd wave** will help us understand the _new_ **4th wave**.

The _previous_ **3rd wave** of social-media includes many names that many people (at the time of writing this article) are familiar with, such as:
Aparat,
Discord,
Facebook,
Instagram,
KakaoTalk,
Reddit,
Slack,
Snapchat,
Telegram,
TikTok,
Twitter,
YouTube,
VK,
WeChat,
Weibo,
WhatsApp,
and many others.

But, also includes many less familiar and now defunct names, such as:
Advogato,
Brightkite,
Busker,
Delicious,
Digg,
Flickr,
Foursqure,
FriendFeed,
Friendster,
Google Plus,
Kuro5hin,
Orkut,
Periscope,
Posterous,
MySpace,
Tumblr,
Vine,
and many others.

With some exception, the previous **3rd wave** of social-media can mostly be characterized as:

* **centralized**
* **walled-gardens**
* **data-silos**
* **corporate owned & controlled**
* **profit focused**
* **engagement maximizing**
* **vendor lock-in**

## 4th Wave

Probably the two most well-known instances from this new social-media revolution are [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) & [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), as they have been received extensive media coverage.
[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) ....
The Fediverse ...
Nostr ...
Farcaster ...



In constrast to that, the new **4th wave** of social-media can be characterized as:

* **decentralized**
* **open platforms**
* **open protocols**, **open data**, **open APIs**,
* **open-source**
* **user focused** or **community focused**,
* ...
* ...

But, why these differences‽
Why do those matter‽

## Computing

...

It is easy to _take for granted_ how ubiquitous computing has become — computing is everywhere.
Laptops,
tablets,
mobile phones,
gaming consoles,
arcade machines,
smart watches,
printers,
WiFi routers,
the cloud,
_and more_.

# 1970s

Nowadays, it is difficult for many to imagine a world where computing was rare or non-existant.
And yet, that was what the world was like for most of the 20th century and before.

If we could take a time-machine back to the mid- 1970s — ...

In fact, I was there, in the 1970s — a young child growing up in Metro Vancouver.
Metro Vancouver, named after the city of _Vancouver_, is a collection of cities on the west-coast of Canada.
Metro Vancouver is also close enough to the United States, and in particular Seattle, that they ....

As a kid in the 1970s, I remember watching live-action kids' TV shows such as: **Sesame Street**, **Boomerang** with Marni Nixon, and **Mr. Dressup**.
I remember watching cartoons such as: **Super Friends**, **The Scooby-Doo Show**, ....
I remember playing with ....
I remember seeing my father's ABBA (music) cassette tapes.
And, I remember ....
...

I also remember that, although bell-bottom jeans were fashionable, a lot (probably most) people didn't wear them.
(Although I have seen photos of my mother wearing bell-bottom jeans when she was young. Which isn't surprising as, the young are often _more susceptible_ to many types of fashions.)

## Home Computer

The mid- 1970s is also the start of the **home computer** era — ... 

## Computer Networks

* [Akkoma](https://akkoma.social/) — micro-blogging
* [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/) — ...
* [Castopod](https://castopod.org/) — ...
* Friendica — ...

## Nostr

## Farcaster

[Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) is a micro-blogging social-media network, similar to Twitter, Bluesky, and Mastodon.
Farcaster has also received attention, due to 

**Farcaster** is currently the smallest of the **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**) networks.
But, the importance of a social-media network is _not_ just about _how many people_ are on the social-network, but also **who** is on the network.

For the blockchain industry — Farcaster is important.

The world of blockchain is divided into 2 large camps — the Bitcoin world and _everyone else_ (who isn't Bitcoin).
In this latter camp — _everyone else (who isn't Bitcoin_) — Ethereum is the largest player.
Although this _latter camp_ also includes:
[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/),
[Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/),
[Base](https://www.base.org/),
[Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/),
[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/),
[Polkadot](https://polkadot.com/),
[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/),
[Solana](https://solana.com/),
[Sonic](https://www.soniclabs.com/),
Zora,
and many, many others.

So, **who** is on Farcaster‽
Farcaster is not only a home for many from this _latter camp_ (of _everyone else_) of the blockchain community, but — it is home for many of the wealthy and influential of this latter camp.

Although, it should be noted that, at least at the time of writing, Twitter (now renamed 𝕏) is also a home for this _latter camp_.
And, Twitter (now renamed 𝕏) not only includes _more_ people from this _latter camp_ (of _everyone else_), but is also _more active_.

Commerce is also much more common on Farcaster, as compared to other decentralized social-media network.

When one spends time on Farcaster, one will eventually hear the phrase — **"sufficiently decentralized"**.
In fact, the Farcaster docs describe Farcaster as such:

> Farcaster is a [sufficiently decentralized](https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks) social network built on Ethereum.

Although, Farcaster is thought of as a blockchain-based social-media network — only part of it exists on a blockchain.
And, in particular, (only part of it exists) on the Optimism blockchain — which is a "layer 2" blockchain built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
Where Farcaster has 3 programs (called "smart contracts") on Optimism.

The rest of Farcaster exists on ....
