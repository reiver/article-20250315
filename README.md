# The 4th Wave of Social-Media: The Rise of Decentralized Networks

**Social-Media is evolving — again.**
From MySpace to Facebook, from Twitter to TikTok, each iteration has reshaped how we connect.
Now, a new revolution is here: **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**).
But what exactly is it, and how does it differ from what came before?
Let’s dive into the **4th wave of social-networking**.

## 3rd Wave

The **4th wave** of social-media marks a **new wave** — and includes **Bluesky**, **Farcaster**, the **Fediverse**, **Mastodon**, **Nostr**, and **Pixelfed**, among others.

But knowing the _previous_ **3rd wave** will help us understand the _new_ **4th wave**.

The _previous_ **3rd wave** of social-media includes many names that many people (at the time of writing this article) are familiar with, such as:
Aparat,
Discord,
Facebook,
Instagram,
KakaoTalk,
Reddit,
Slack,
Snapchat,
Telegram,
TikTok,
Twitter,
YouTube,
VK,
WeChat,
Weibo,
WhatsApp,
and many others.

But, also includes many less familiar and now defunct names, such as:
Advogato,
Brightkite,
Busker,
Delicious,
Digg,
Flickr,
Foursqure,
FriendFeed,
Friendster,
Google Plus,
Kuro5hin,
Orkut,
Periscope,
Posterous,
MySpace,
Tumblr,
Vine,
and many others.

With some exception, the previous **3rd wave** of social-media can mostly be characterized as:

* **centralized**
* **walled-gardens**
* **data-silos**
* **corporate owned & controlled**
* **profit focused**
* **engagement maximizing**
* **vendor lock-in**

## 4th Wave

Probably the two most well-known instances from this new social-media revolution are [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) & [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), as they have been received extensive media coverage.
[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) ....
The Fediverse ...
Nostr ...
Farcaster ...



In constrast to that, the new **4th wave** of social-media can be characterized as:

* **decentralized**
* **open platforms**
* **open protocols**, **open data**, **open APIs**,
* **open-source**
* **user focused** or **community focused**,
* ...
* ...

But, why these differences‽
Why do those matter‽

## Computing

...

It is easy to _take for granted_ how ubiquitous computing has become — computing is everywhere.
Laptops,
tablets,
mobile phones,
gaming consoles,
arcade machines,
smart watches,
printers,
WiFi routers,
the cloud,
_and more_.

# 1970s

Nowadays, it is difficult for many to imagine a world where computing was rare or non-existant.
And yet, that was what the world was like for most of the 20th century and before.

If we could take a time-machine back to the mid- 1970s — ...

In fact, I was there, in the 1970s — a young child growing up in Metro Vancouver.
Metro Vancouver, named after the city of _Vancouver_, is a collection of cities on the west-coast of Canada.
Metro Vancouver is also close enough to the United States, and in particular Seattle, that they ....

As a kid in the 1970s, I remember watching live-action kids' TV shows such as: **Sesame Street**, **Boomerang** with Marni Nixon, and **Mr. Dressup**.
I remember watching cartoons such as: **Super Friends**, **The Scooby-Doo Show**, ....
I remember playing with ....
I remember seeing my father's ABBA (music) cassette tapes.
And, I remember ....

I also remember that, although bell-bottom jeans were fashionable, a lot (probably most) people didn't wear them.
(Although I have seen photos of my mother wearing bell-bottom jeans when she was young. Which isn't surprising as, the young are often _more susceptible_ to many types of fashions.)

## Farcaster

[Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) is the smallest of the **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**) networks.
But, the importance of a social-media network is _not_ just about _how many people_ are on the social-network, but also **who** is on the network.

For the blockchain industry — Farcaster is important.

The world of blockchain is divided into 2 large camps — Bitcoin and everyone else who isn't Bitcoin.
And with the latter camp — _everyone who isn't Bitcoin_, Ethereum is the largest player.
Athough the latter camp also includes: Solana, ....
